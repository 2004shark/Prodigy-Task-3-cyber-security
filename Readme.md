Using Python 2.7.12 I wrote a simple little script, psk_validate.py, that prompts the user for a potential password and checks if it has upper and lower-case characters, numbers, special characters, and that it has a length of at least 8 characters.

From what I understand one could use the regex library to write this much more efficiently, however, I have yet to learn about regex.

The program seems to work just fine, and with a program this small I think that not using regex is also just fine.

I'd like any and all feedback about this program. In particular, I'd like to know if a program written this simply could be used in real-world applications. I'd also like to know if there are any logical errors and/or bugs in the program.
